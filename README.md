This project is a lightweight Core Banking System example which mimics what real world banks might use. There are still a lot of important aspects missing such as chaching forex rates as well as not having an audit database. Most of all it still uses a monolithic method call structure as opposed to microservices architecture in use today. However, for the most part, it does what real world banking systems do. In terms of user creation, account creation and transactions, as well as logging all transactions to a table.
